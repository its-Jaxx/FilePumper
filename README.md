Created by jaxx#0001 - If you want to distribute it, please credit me.

You can either download the existing .exe file or you can compile it yourself using the source files.

How to use it:

Once launched, enter your file path and press enter.
Example on this -> C:\Users\jaxx\FilePumper\FilePumper.exe

Now enter how many kilobytes you wish to add to your file and press enter.
My program will now pump your file with x amount kilobytes.

You will have to relaunch the program every time you wish to pump a file.
